<H2>SL275: Module7: Advanced Class Features</H2>
<H3>Exercise #2: Use Interfaces and Abstract Classes</H3>
<H3>(Level 2)</H3>
</CENTER>


<H3>Objective</H3>

<P>
In this exercise you will create a hierarchy of animals that is rooted in
an abstract class <TT>Animal</TT>. Several of the animal classes will
implement an interface called <TT>Pet</TT>. You will experiment with
variations of these animals, their methods, and polymorphism.
</P>


<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>

<OL>

  <LI>Create the <TT>Animal</TT> class, which is the abstract superclass of
      all animals.
      <OL>
        <LI>Declare a protected integer attribute called <TT>legs</TT>, which
	    records the number of legs for this animal.
        <LI>Define a protected constructor that initializes the <TT>legs</TT> attribute.
        <LI>Declare an abstract method <TT>eat</TT>.
        <LI>Declare a concrete method <TT>walk</TT> that prints out something
	    about how the animals walks (include the number of legs).
      </OL>
      <P>

  <LI>Create the <TT>Spider</TT> class.
      <OL>
        <LI>The <TT>Spider</TT> class extends the <TT>Animal</TT> class.
        <LI>Define a default constructor that calls the superclass constructor
	    to specify that all spiders have eight legs.
        <LI>Implement the <TT>eat</TT> method.
      </OL>
      <P>

  <LI>Create the <TT>Pet</TT> interface specified by the UML diagram.
      <P>

  <LI>Create the <TT>Cat</TT> class that extends <TT>Animal</TT> and
      implements <TT>Pet</TT>.
      <OL>
        <LI>This class must include a <TT>String</TT>
	    attribute to store the name of the pet.
        <LI>Define a constructor that takes one <TT>String</TT> parameter
	    that specifies the cat's name.  This constructor must also call
	    the superclass constructor to specify that all cats have four legs.
        <LI>Define another constructor that takes no parameters.  Have this
	    constructor call the previous constructor (using the <TT>this</TT>
	    keyword) and pass an empty string as the argument.
        <LI>Implement the <TT>Pet</TT> interface methods.
        <LI>Implement the <TT>eat</TT> method.
      </OL>
      <P>

  <LI>Create the <TT>Fish</TT> class.  Override the <TT>Animal</TT> methods
      to specify that fish can't walk and don't have legs.
      <P>

  <LI>Create an <TT>TestAnimals</TT> program.  Have the <TT>main</TT> method
      create and manipulate instances of the classes you created above.
      Start with:
<PRE>
Fish d = new Fish();
Cat c = new Cat("Fluffy");
Animal a = new Fish();
Animal e = new Spider();
Pet p = new Cat();
</PRE>
      Experiment by: a) calling the methods in each object, b) casting objects,
      c) using polymorphism, and d) using <TT>super</TT> to call super
      class methods.
      <P>

</OL>
