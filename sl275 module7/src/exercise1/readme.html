<H3>Exercise #1: Use the Singleton Design Pattern</H3>
<H3>(Level 2)</H3>
</CENTER>


<H3>Objective</H3>

<P>
In this exercise you will modify the <TT>Bank</TT> class to implement the
Singleton design pattern.
</P>


<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>
Start by changing your working directory to <TT>SL275/mod07/exercise1</TT> on your computer.
Copy your all of the Java files from exercise #2 of the "Inheritance" module
into the <TT>banking.domain</TT> package directory.
</P>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=red>
Note: at this stage the Banking Project has need for a more complex
package hierarchy because we will be creating a <TT>CustomerReport</TT> class
which belongs in the <TT>banking.reports</TT> package. Therefore, the
"domain" classes need to be placed in the <TT>banking/domain</TT>
directory. Also, you will need to change the package declaration for each
of these files.

<P>

<OL><TT></TT>

  <LI>Modify the <TT>Bank</TT> class to create a public static method,
      called <TT>getBank</TT>, that returns an instance of the <TT>Bank</TT> class.
      <P>

  <LI>The single instance should be a static attribute and should be private.
      Likewise, make the <TT>Bank</TT> constructor private.
      <P>

</OL>

</P>


<H4>Modify the <TT>CustomerReport</TT> Class</H4>

<P>
In the previous Banking Project exercise, the "customer report" was
embedded in the <TT>main</TT> method of the <TT>TestBanking</TT> program.
In this exercise, this code has been pulled out into the <TT>CustomerReport</TT> class
in the <TT>banking.reports</TT> package. Your task will be to modify this
class to use the Singleton bank object.
</P>

<OL><TT></TT>

  <LI>Hunt for the line of code marked by the comment block <TT>/*** ... ***/</TT>
     <BR>
      Modify this line to retrieve the Singleton bank object.
      <P>

</OL>


<H4>Compile and Run the <TT>TestBanking</TT> Program</H4>

<OL>

  <LI>Compile and run this program.  You should see the following output.
