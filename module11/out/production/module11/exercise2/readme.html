<H3>Exercise #2: Create a Calculator GUI, Part II</H3>
<H3>(Level 2)</H3>
</CENTER>


<H3>Objective</H3>

<P>
In this exercise you will complete the implementation of the "calculator" GUI.
You will create the event handlers that satisfy "calculator" behavior.
</P>


<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>
Start by coping the <TT>CalculatorGUI</TT> class file into your working directory.
</P>

<P>
You task is to implement the <TT>ActionListener</TT> handlers for each of
the buttons in the GUI.  To make your job easier, you may wish to copy the
<TT>Calculator</TT> class in the <TT>solution</TT> directory.  You can use
an instance of this class as the model of "calculator" behavior.  The
behavior of this object is very simple.  There is a method for each operation
(<TT>opAdd</TT>, <TT>opSubtract</TT>, <TT>opMultiply</TT>, and <TT>opDivide</TT>)
and the equals sign (<TT>opEquals</TT>).  Each of these methods takes a single
number (of type <TT>String</TT>) and returns a result (also of type <TT>String</TT>).
Here is an example:
<PRE>
...
  Calculator calc = new Calculator();
  String result;

  result = calc.opMultiply("3.25");  // result is "3.25"
  result = calc.opAdd("2");          // result is "6.5"
  result = calc.opEquals("5");       // result is "11.5"
...
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
Using a model allows you to separate the logic of the applications behavior
from the presentation and control of the application.  This is a classic
example of the design pattern of Model-View-Controller.  In this case the
<TT>Calculator</TT> class implements the model and the <TT>CalculatorGUI</TT>
class implements both the view (the buttons, frame and layout) and the
controller (the event handlers).
