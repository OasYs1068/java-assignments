<H3>Exercise #1: Write a File with Numbered Lines</H3>
<H3>(Level 1)</H3>
</CENTER>


<H3>Objective</H3>

<P>
In this exercise you will create a program to read text from standard input
and write it to a file with each line prefixed with a line-number count.
This file will be specified by a command-line argument.
</P>


<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>

<OL><TT></TT>

  <LI>Create a program called <TT>TestLineNumbering</TT> that accepts one
      command-line argument, the name of a file. Your code should verify
      that the command-line argument was specified.
      <P>

  <LI>Declare a variable that holds a <TT>File</TT> object that is initialized
      from the file named in the first command-line argument.
      <P>

  <LI>Within a <TT>try-catch</TT> block, create a buffered, input stream
      reader based on the <TT>System.in</TT> stream (standard input).
      <P>

  <LI>Also, create a print file writer based on the <TT>File</TT> variable.
      <P>

  <LI>Write the <TT>while</TT> loop that reads each line from the console
      input stream and prints the line out to the file.  Each line should
      be prepended with the count of the line number.
      <P>

  <LI>Make sure to close the I/O streams.
      <P>
