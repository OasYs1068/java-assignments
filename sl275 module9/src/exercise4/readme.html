<H3>Exercise #4: Sort Customers</H3>
<H3>(Level 3)</H3>
</CENTER>


<H3>Objective</H3>

<P>
In this exercise you will sort the list of bank customers by their names.
This will require you to have the <TT>Customer</TT> class implement the
<TT>Comparable</TT> interface.
</P>


<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>
Start by changing your working directory to <TT>SL275/mod09/exercise4</TT>
on your computer.  Copy the previous Banking project files.
</P>


<OL>

  <LI>Add the <TT>sortCustomers</TT> method to the <TT>Bank</TT> class.
      <P>

  <LI>Modify the <TT>Customer</TT> class to implement the <TT>Comparable</TT>
      interface.  You will need to specify the <TT>compareTo</TT> method.
      Make this method compare the two customers in a lexigraphical order
      with the last name taking precedence over the first name.  For example,
      "Joe Smith" should come before "Samuel Smith".
      <P>

  <LI>Modify the <TT>CustomerReport</TT> class to call the <TT>sortCustomers</TT>
      method before generating the report.
      <P>

  <LI>Compile and run the <TT>TestBanking</TT> program.  You should see the
      following output:
