<H3>Exercise #2: Develop a Directory Listing Program</H3>
<H3>(Level 3)</H3>
</CENTER>


<H3>Objective</H3>

<P>
In this exercise you will create a program to print out a directory listing
for the directory specified by the last command-line argument (or the
current working directory, if no argument was specified).  You will also
use a command-line switch, <TT>-R</TT>, to specify whether or not to
recursively descend into the directory tree.
</P>


<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>
Create a program called <TT>DirListing</TT> that takes a command-line
argument to specify a directory that you wish to be listed.  Furthermore,
two command-line switches must be supported.  The <TT>-verbose</TT> switch
tells the program to display the size of the file and date last modified;
"non-verbose" mode just shows the file name.  The <TT>-R</TT> switch tells
the program to show the directory specified and recursively descend into
the sub-directories and display these (with some spacing for indentation).
</P>

<P>
Usage:
<PRE>
java DirListing [-R] [-verbose] [directory]
