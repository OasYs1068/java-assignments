<H3>Exercise #1: Finish the ChatClient</H3>
<H3>(Level 2)</H3>
</CENTER>


<H3>Objective</H3>

<P>
In this exercise you will finish the "chat room" client program.  Your
client will connect to a "chat server" so that you may chat with other
students in the class.
</P>


<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>
Start by changing your working directory to <TT>SL275/mod16/exercise1</TT>
on your computer.  Copy the previous ChatRoom files in this working directory.
</P>

<OL>

  <LI>In the <TT>launchFrame</TT> method, you need to make the connection
      to the server (make a socket connection).
      <P>

  <LI>You need to get streams (input and output) from the socket connection
      so that you can send your messages to the server, and receive other
      messages from the server.
      <P>

  <LI>You need a <TT>RemoteReader</TT> -- a runnable object -- which can be
      run by a thread and continually listen for input on the input stream
      you got from the socket.
      <P>

  <LI>You need to modify the <TT>actionPerformed</TT> method so that when the
      user clicks the "send" button you send the text of the message 
      <EM>to the server</EM> (using the output stream) rather than putting it into
      the text area.
      <P>

  <LI>You need to modify the action listener on the "input" text field to
      do the same as above (send the message to the server).
      <P>

  <LI>You need to have the <TT>RemoteReader</TT> object put the 
      incoming messages into the text area.
      <P>

</OL>

<B>Good luck and have fun!</B>

<FONT COLOR=blue><H4>Hints</H4></FONT>

<OL>

  <LI>You need instance variables for input and output streams and the socket.
Do NOT make these local variables.
      
<PRE>
Socket connection;
PrintStream serverOut;
BufferedReader serverIn;
</PRE>
      <P>

  <LI><TT>RemoteReader</TT> implements <TT>Runnable</TT> should be an inner class.
      
      <P>

  <LI>Put all the connection code (and get the streams) in the <TT>launchFrame</TT> method.
      
      <P>

  <LI>Instantiate RemoteReader (<TT>RemoteReader r = new RemoteReader();</TT>) in your
<TT>launchFrame</TT> method, then instantiate a Thread object using <TT>r</TT> as the runnable target.
      
      <P>

  <LI>Start the thread for the RemoteReader (<TT>t.start();</TT>) as the last thing you
do before making your Frame visible.
      
      <P>

  <LI>Don't forget you are using two new packages <TT>java.io</TT> and <TT>java.net</TT>.
      
      <P>

  <LI>Your RemoteReaders should have a <TT>run</TT> method which runs in a <TT>while(true)</TT> loop.
      
      <P>

  <LI>Don't forget to surround your risky code (like anything connected with
reading, sockets, etc.) in a try/catch block!
      
      <P>

<FONT COLOR=blue><H4>General How-to</H4></FONT>

<OL>

  <LI>How to make a socket:
<PRE>
connection = new Socket(hostnameOrIP,portNum);
Example: connection = new Socket("127.0.0.1",2000);
</PRE>
      <P>

  <LI>How to get streams from the socket:
<PRE>
serverIn = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()));
serverOut = new PrintStream(connection.getOutputStream());
</PRE>
      <P>

  <LI>How to write to a PrintStream (a type of output stream)
<PRE>
serverOut.println("Yippy Skippy");
</PRE>
      <P>

  <LI>How to read from a BufferedReader:
<PRE>
String aLine = serverIn.readLine(); 
// This blocks until there is something to read.
</PRE>
      <P>

<PRE>
// Many import statements

public class ChatClient {

  // lots of instance variables for send button, socket, streams, etc.

  public ChatClient() {
    // initialize GUI components and other data
  }

  public void launchFrame() {
    // make the GUI

    // establish socket connection

    // make a thread and start it with an instance of RemoteReader

    // create/instantiate the streams from the socket connection

    // show the gui
  }

  // the inner class listening for the send button
  private class SendListener implements ActionListener {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
      // get info from text field

      // send it to the server using the printstream object

      // clear the text field
    }
  }

  // an inner class to listen to server
  private class RemoteReader implements Runnable { 
    public void run() {
      try {
        while(true) {
	  // do stuff here to continuously read from the server using the 

	  // input stream you made

	  // put the received text into the text area
	}
      }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // create an instance of ChatClient

    // call the launchFrame method
