<H3>Exercise #3: Use Advanced Thread Control</H3>
<H3>(Level 3)</H3>
</CENTER>


<H3>Objective</H3>

<P>
In this exercise you will use wait/notify and proper thread control to
create a printer manager.  You will create several threads that generate
print jobs and a single print manager thread to process those jobs.
</P>


<H3>Directions</H3>

<CENTER> <IMG SRC="UML.gif" ALT="The UML Diagram for this exercise"> </CENTER>

<OL>

  <H4>Create the <TT>PrintJob</TT> Class</H4>

  <LI>Create the <TT>PrintJob</TT> class based on the UML diagram.
      <P>

  <H4>Create the <TT>Producer</TT> Class</H4>

  <LI>Create the <TT>Producer</TT> class based on the UML diagram.
      It must implement the <TT>Runnable</TT> interface.
      <P>

  <LI>Write a constructor that initializes all four instance variables.
      
      <P>

  <LI>The <TT>run</TT> method must generate a certain number of print jobs,
      based on the <TT>numberOfJobs</TT> attribute.  Give each of these jobs
      a name based on the <TT>producerName</TT> and the number of the job.
      The number of pages in the print job is specified by the <TT>sizeOfJobs</TT>
      attribute.
      <P>

  <LI>Add the print job to the printer manager via the <TT>addJob</TT> method.
      This method might throw an <TT>FullQueueException</TT>, write code to
      handle this occurrance. Print out a message that the producer is adding
      a job to the print queue.
      <P>

  <LI>Between print jobs the producer must sleep based on the <TT>delayBetweenJobs</TT> attribute.
      
      <P>

  <H4>Create the <TT>Printer</TT> Class</H4>

  <LI>Create the <TT>Printer</TT> class based on the UML diagram.
      <P>

  <LI>Write a contructor that initializes the attributes appropriately.
      The print queue should be big enough to handle five simultaneous jobs.
      <P>

  <LI>You may want to implement this class as a Singleton.
      <P>

  <LI>The <TT>printQueue</TT> attribute is a FIFO queue that holds all
      print jobs that have been posted to this printer.  I have included
      the Java classes that you need for this data structure.  <TT>Queue</TT>
      is an interface of FIFO queues.  <TT>CircularQueue</TT> implements a
      fixed-length queue.  The <TT>FullQueueException</TT> and <TT>EmptyQueueException</TT>
      are thrown by the <TT>addBack</TT> and <TT>removeFront</TT> methods
      respectively.
      <P>

  <LI>Write a public, synchronized <TT>addJob</TT> method.  This method might
      throw a <TT>FullQueueException</TT>.
      <P>

  <LI>Write a private, synchronized <TT>getJob</TT> method.  This method might
      throw a <TT>EmptyQueueException</TT>.
      <P>

  <LI>Write the public, synchronized <TT>halt</TT> method.  This method should
      set the <TT>stateIsRunning</TT> to <TT>false</TT>.
      <P>

  <LI>Write the <TT>run</TT> method.  This is the heart of the print manager.
      It must loop continueously, until it has been halted.  It must retrieve
      a print job off the queue, print out that the job is starting (and give
      the name of the job), process the job (by sleeping a certain number of
      milliseconds per page; 500ms/page is a good value), and then print out
      that the job has completed.  If no job is available, print out that the
      printer is waiting for a job.
      <P>

  <LI>The hard part of this exercise is where to use <TT>wait</TT> and
      <TT>notify</TT>.  <FONT COLOR=blue>Hint: "synchronize" the wait/notify
      on the <TT>Printer</TT> object.</FONT>
      <P>


  <H4>Create the <TT>TestPrinter</TT> Program</H4>

  <LI>This class only contains a <TT>main</TT> method.
      
      <P>

  <LI>Have the <TT>main</TT> method create three producers, with differentt
      printing characteristics: from small (5 page) to large (25 page) job
      sizes, and short (2 sec) to long (10 sec) delays between jobs.
      <P>

  <LI>Create a thread for the printer manager.  Set the priority of this
      job to the maximum. Start this thread.
      <P>

  <LI>Create three threads for each producer.  Start the threads.
      <P>

  <LI>Wait for each producer thread to finish, using the <TT>join</TT> method.
      <P>

  <LI>Finally, halt the printer manager.
      <P>

</OL>
